   key [x], if an empty slot is encountered, then the search stops, as the
   data structure's invariant guarantees that [x] cannot appear beyond this
   empty slot; whereas if a tombstone is encountered, then the search
   continues, as [x] could appear beyond this tombstone. In other words, we
   maintain the following invariant: if [x] is in the table then it must
   appear between the index [start s x] and the first [void] slot. *)

(* Furthermore (this is optional), we maintain the invariant that a [tomb]
   slot is never followed with a [void] slot. To achieve this, in [remove],
   if the key that is being removed is followed with [void], then this key
   and all preceding tombstones are overwritten with [void]. This makes
